# Pirate Zobmies
Greetings, welcome to "Zombie Pirates" - a multiplayer FPS game that offers a unique twist. In this maritime realm, you embody the undead as you navigate through a treasure-laden island, engaging in fierce shootouts with other players.

Embark on this subtle yet engaging journey, where the undead roam and the thrill of the high seas awaits. 

## Controls

The mechanics are elegantly simple: each round spans a brief 5 minutes, and victory belongs to the player with the highest kill count. Maneuver effortlessly with WSAD, fire away with a left-click, gracefully leap with the spacebar, toggle cursor control with Alt, and check scores discreetly with 'H'.

## Need help bringing multiplayer functionality to your game?
Crafted with precision in Godot, utilizing WebRTC for a seamless multiplayer experience, "Zombie Pirates" promises an immersive gaming adventure.

I'm open to commissions and happy to discuss any projects or ideas you might have. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or if there's anything I can help you with in the realm of multiplayer game development.
